# Computer Vision with OpenCV and Python
Guided Project: ```IBMSkillsNetwork GPXX01QSEN```
***

### Objectives
After completing this project, i will be able to:
- Confidently navigate and manipulate images using popular Python libraries such as `OpenCV`, and `Matplotlib`.
- Load images with `OpenCV` and plot them using `Matplotlib`, giving you a deeper understanding of image processing techniques.
- Combine two images side-by-side with `Pillow` in Python, opening up endless creative possibilities for image manipulation.
- Convert images into grayscale and its RGB (Red,Green,Blue) channels, allowing you to experiment with different color schemes and tones.
- Use indexing of `Numpy` arrays to crop and manipulate images, providing you with even more creative control over your image processing projects.

Here are some real-life applications of the skills learned in this project:
- Image editing and manipulation: By using the techniques learned in this project, users can edit and manipulate images to create new artworks, edit photographs, and add visual effects to videos.
- Computer vision and machine learning: The techniques learned in this project can be applied to preprocess and manipulate images used in computer vision and machine learning applications, such as image recognition, object detection, and segmentation.

### Setup
For this project, we will be using the following libraries:

*   [`os`](https://pandas.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for interacting with file system paths.
*   [`cv2`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for performing image processing and computer vision tasks.
*   [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for displaying images.
